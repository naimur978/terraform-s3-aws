# Terraform S3 AWS

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to provision and manage AWS S3 resources. It is intended for learning, experimentation, and as a template for future infrastructure-as-code projects.

## Access Link
You can access the deployed site here:
[https://terraformprojectawss3dssnp.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html](https://terraformprojectawss3dssnp.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html)

## What I Am Doing
This project provisions AWS S3 buckets and demonstrates how to manage cloud resources using Terraform. It also covers basic IAM (Identity and Access Management) concepts for secure access control.
## Technologies Used
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool for provisioning and managing cloud resources
- **AWS S3**: Scalable cloud storage service from Amazon Web Services
- **AWS IAM**: Identity and Access Management for secure access and permissions
- **HTML**: Used for basic documentation and error pages
## Prerequisites
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed
- AWS account and credentials configured (e.g., via AWS CLI or environment variables)
- Internet access to reach AWS services

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Configure your AWS credentials
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the project
4. Run `terraform plan` to see the execution plan
5. Run `terraform apply -auto-approve` to provision resources without manual approval

### Destroying Resources
To remove all resources created by this project, run:
`terraform destroy -auto-approve`
Use this command when you want to clean up and delete all infrastructure provisioned by your Terraform configuration, such as when you are finished testing or no longer need the resources.

## Documentation
For details on the AWS S3 bucket resource, see the official Terraform documentation:
[Terraform AWS S3 Bucket Resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket)

## Project Files
The following files were manually created and edited:
- `error.html`: Custom error page for S3 website hosting
- `index.html`: Main landing page for the S3-hosted site
- `main.tf`: Main Terraform configuration for AWS resources
- `outputs.tf`: Defines and outputs key Terraform values
- `provider.tf`: Specifies the AWS provider configuration
- `variables.tf`: Declares input variables for Terraform
- `profile.jpg`: Example image file used in the S3 bucket

Other files (such as state files and lock files) are auto-generated by Terraform and should not be edited manually.
