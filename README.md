# Terraform S3 AWS

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to provision and manage AWS S3 resources. It is intended for learning, experimentation, and as a template for future infrastructure-as-code projects.

## What I Am Doing
- Creating and configuring AWS S3 buckets using Terraform
- Managing infrastructure state and outputs
- Practicing infrastructure-as-code principles

## Technologies Used
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool for provisioning cloud resources
- **AWS S3**: Cloud storage service from Amazon Web Services
- **HTML**: For basic documentation and error pages

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Configure your AWS credentials
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the project
4. Run `terraform plan` to see the execution plan
5. Run `terraform apply -auto-approve` to provision resources without manual approval
